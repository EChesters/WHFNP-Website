# WHFNP-Website

Women Hack for Non Profits is a meet-up aimed at promoting women's influence i the pen source tech community. Starting in May 2015, we are a new community who need a new website! 
We believe in keeping our projects open source, and here you can even find our mock-ups for our very own website. 

Creating prototypes in HTML also allows a more realistic view of the end result. We can then pass this repo to any user and they can interact a lot more easily with working links to other pages. 

## Tech Stack
These mockups use HTML, and SASS. 
To compile the SASS you must have Ruby installed. 

For ease of use when making SASS changes use
`sass --watch`

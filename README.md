# WHFNP-Website

Women Hack for Non Profits is a meet-up aimed at promoting women's influence i the pen source tech community. Starting in May 2015, we are a new community who need a new website! 
We believe in keeping our projects open source, and here you can even find our mock-ups for our very own website. 

Creating prototypes in HTML also allows a more realistic view of the end result. We can then pass this repo to any user and they can interact a lot more easily with working links to other pages. 

## Tech Stack
We are using Jekyll, with the CSS pre-processor, SASS.

To run, use `jekyll serve`

This does have a Ruby dependency.
